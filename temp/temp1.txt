 ABSTRACT
 Manuscript submission systems are a 
central fixture in scholarly 
publishing
. However, 
with 
existing systems
, r
esearchers
 must 
trust that 
their yet 
unpublished findings
 will not 
prematurely
 be 
disseminated
 due to technical 
weaknesses
 and that anonymous 
peer reviewers 
or committee members 
will not plagiarize 
unpublished 
content
. To address 
this
 limitation
, we 
present 
CryptSubmit 
 a system
 that automatically create
s a decentralized
, tamperproof, 
and 
publicly
 verifiable 
timestamp for 
each
 submitted 
manuscript
 by 
utilizing the blockchain
 of t
he cryptocurrency 
Bitcoin
. The 
publicly
 accessible and tamperproof 
infrastructure
 of 
the blockchain 
allows researchers to 
independ
ently verify the 
validity of the
 timestamp associated with their manuscript
 at the 
time of submiss
ion to a conference or journ
al. Our system 
supports researchers in protecting their intellectual property even 
in the face of vulnerable submission platforms or dishonest peer 
reviewers. Optionally, the system also generates trusted 
timestamps for the feedback shared by peer reviewer
s to increase 
the traceability of ideas. 
CryptSubmit 
integrates these features 
into 
the open source conference management system OJS. 
In the 
future, the method could be integrated at nearly no overhead cost 
into other manuscript submission systems, such as
 EasyChair, 
ConfTool, or Ambra. The introduced method can also improve 
electronic pre
-print services and storage systems for research data.

 Manuscript submission 
systems 
have become
 a standard tool
 in scholarly publishing. These systems 
help
 organizers of 
academic 
conferences and journals coordinate 
all stages of
 the publishing 
process: from 
abstract and manuscript submission, 
to organizing 
peer
 review
, and finally
 receiving
 camera
-ready
 manuscripts
. Manuscript submission 
systems
 have significantly 
reduced
 the 
receipt
-to-acceptance 
wait 
time
, thus benefiting organizers and 
researchers alike
 [16]. Although manuscript submission sy
stems have made 
peer review
 more 
efficient, 
technical weaknesses and 
potential 
dishonesty 
of the involved 
individuals 
threaten the 
integrity of the 
scientific peer review 
process
. A first weakness, of
 technical 
nature, 
is the lack of standards for
 the secur
e architecture
 of 
manuscript submission 
systems
. To 
give
 one example, 
from 200
4 - 2011, 
Sheridan Printing

management software
, which was used by many 
ACM 
conferences, including WWW 
and SIGCHI, featured 
an easily 
guessable naming scheme fo
r paper submissions 
[17]. This
 weakness 
enabled anyone with the base URL to systematically 
retrieve all papers submitted to a conference
 months before their 
publication.
 Such 
data leaks from submission platforms 
can lead
 to the premature 
release 
of results
, the 
plagiarism of ideas, or even 
the loss of 
potential 
patent applications 
if the description of an
 idea is 
made 
openly available on
 the W
eb.
  A further weakness, 
this time
 of human
 nature, is the 
risk of 
bias 
or fraud
 in the 
peer
-review process
. Some reviewers 
may 
criticize 
a submitted 
manuscript
 more harshly than justified with the aim of 
delaying 
competing researchers
. In extreme
 cases, peer
 reviewers, 
chairs, or 
editors may reject
 a manuscript
 only to use 
its valuable 
findings 
in their
 own research 
and publication
. Such unethical 
behavior is likely rare
. However, 
several cases have been 
publicized 
in which 
peer
 reviewers
 plagiarized ideas and results 
from the unpublished manuscripts
 they reviewed 
[3, 5, 14, 15]
. Only r
ecently
, a medical 
researcher 
discovered that 
five
 
worth of
 
data
 had 
been plagiarized
 and published.
 The
 plagiarist 
had 
received access to 
this data while acting as 
a peer 
reviewer for 
a prestigious medical journal
, where he 
had rejected
 the original 
manuscript
 before
 publish
ing the 
data
 as if it
 was his own [4]. Such severe 
cases
 of 
academic misconduct remind us
 that entrusting anonymous reviewers with novel research
 results 
via a
 submission
 system 
poses a risk for plagiarism
.  While the 
problem of academic plagiarism is as old as academia 
itself 
[12] and can never be entirely eliminated, 
the development 
and use of more sophisticated plagiarism detection 
systems 
can 
help
 examiners 
to more
 quickly 
discover
 the extent of plagiarism
, as well as 
to increas
e the effort 
plagiarists must put forth to avoid 
detection
 [6, 11]
. We 
expect
 that having
 a means to securely 
verify
 priority for 
research 
manuscript
s upon their submission 
represents 
one 
additional deterrence against 
academic 
plagiarism.
 However, c
urrently
, researchers are missing a 
method
 to 
securely 
and effortlessly 
prove their 
academic 
contribution
s in the 
face of
 data leakage or 
reviewer 
fraud. 
   978-1-5386-3861-3/17/$31.00 ©2017 IEEEThe question arises:
 How can researchers 
verify 
that their contribution already existed 
at the
 time
 of submission 
to a conference
 or journal? In this paper
, we propose a 
method
 which enables researcher
s to securely verify the 
existence of 
research 
ideas, data, 
or results 
at the time of 
a manuscript
 submission
 for review
. The proposed 
method generates
 a hash, i.e. 
a unique 
fingerprint
, of 
the research 
manuscript and 
accompanying
 data
, if included. 
The
 hash is 
embedded
 in the
 tamper
proof blockchain of 
the cryptocurrency 
Bitcoin, however, any
 blockchain
, e.g. Ethereum
, could equally be 
used for this purpose
. This approach
, coined in a previous paper 
as decentralized trusted timestamping 
[7], associates 
a digital file
 with a tamperproof
 timestamp 
recorded on the blockchain 
that 
is 
permanently and 
public
ly verifiable
. If a manuscript

 is misappropriated 
later
, the 
trusted 
timestamp
 allows
 the 
author 
to 
prove that the manuscript 
already existed 
in a precise state 
when it was submitted to 
a conference 
or journal
  fully 
independent of 
the 
manuscript 
submission system used.
 2. EXISTING SYSTEMS
 While several applications 
exist that 

for trusted
-timestamping 
[2, 9]
, no system
 exists
 that
 utilizes
 the 
blockchain with the objective 
of enabling researchers to 
document 
priority for 
their 
academic manuscript
s. 
ystems 
supporting the academic 
publishing process can 
be categori
zed into 
electronic publishing systems, also referred to 
as journal management 
systems, 
and conference management 
systems
. Both types
 of systems
 support the 
peer
-review process
: from accepting
 manuscript 
submissions
, over 
selecting 
reviewers
 and managing 
their
 feedback
, to accepting 
the final manuscript 
and formatting
 it for publication.
 Conference management 
systems
 typically 
include event organization 
functionalit
ies, as 
well as 
registration
 and payment handling
. Since our 
presented
 approach addresses
 the peer
-revie
w process
, we examine
 both 
system 
types
, as long as they offer a 
peer
-review 
functionality
.  Editorial Manager

is a widely-used commercial 
journal 
management system. 
Publishers
, such as Springer
 Nature, 
BMC and PLO
S, employ
 this 
mature and feature
-rich 
system
 to manage thousands of journals
. Among
 academic
 conference 
management system
s, EasyChair
2 and ConfTool3 are 
widely-used 
solutions. B
oth systems 
follow 
a freemium business model
, i.e.
, offer
ing a free
 basic vers
ion, while requiring payment for
 more 
advanced features
. The
 code of 
the
 systems 
is not open
 source
 and 
. A review of 
additional 
systems can be found in 
[13].  In the following, we focus on popular 
open
-source
 systems
, since 
these 
give us
 the 
opportunity
 to instantaneously integrate 
the capability of 
trusted 
timestamping
. Ambra

 Java-based 
journal management system
 maintained by the Public Library of 
Science (PLOS)
 and employed by several PLOS journals.
 The PHP-based
 Ope
n Journal System
 (OJS)
5 offers 
comparable 
features and degree of maturity
 as Ambra
. OJS is 
developed 
by 
the Public Knowledge Project
, which
 also

HotCRP
7 is an 
alternative 
open-source
 conference 
management 
system
 used by 
several 
ACM SIG
 conferences
. OJS, 
OCS and 
HotCRP offer the option of using a hosted instance 
of 
the system
s for a fee.
 Deploying the system
s 
is free of charge
, as is the case for 
Ambra
.  While openly available
 manuscript submission systems exist
, they 
share the same shortcoming: 
they provide 
authors 
with 
no mechanism to 
obtain a persistent piece of evidence that is 
independent of the system itself and enables authors to verifiably 
prove th
at a research work was submitted at a given time. 
The most evidence 
provided by 
existing sy
stems 
is a confirmation 
email to acknowledge
 the 
receipt
 of the manuscript. However, 
the verifiability of 
the content of 
confirmation 
emails depends
 on 
the 
availability of a corresponding 
data 
record on the side of the 
publisher to 
whom 
the manuscript was submitted. 
This record 
can 
easily go missing, e.g.
, due to limited retention periods for such 
data, because the 
manuscript submission
 system changes, or
 because the publisher ceases to exist. The data record may also be 
manipulated, e.g., by 
malicious conference organizers
 or editors 
who plan to plagiarize 
from submitted 
work.  3. SYSTEM CONCEPT
 Having described
 the limitations of existing manus
cript 
submiss
ion systems, 
we present
 the concept and prototype
, CryptSubmit8, which we implemented into the open
-source 
manuscript submission 
system
 OJS. CryptSubmit uses the 
blockchain of Bitcoin to enable tamperproof, decentralized 
timestamping of all data exchanged during the manuscript 
submission and peer review process. 
Section
 3.1
 describes the 
blockchain
-based approach to timestamping and our service 
OriginStamp, which CryptSubmit uses to generate trusted 
timestamps. Section 
3.2
 presents details on
 CryptSubmit.
 3.1 Trusted Timestamping on the Blockchain
 We introduced decentralized trusted timestamping of digital files 
using the blockchain of a cryptocurrency as the medium for 
timestamp generation and verification in 
[7]. With OriginStamp
9, we provide a non
-commercial, web
-based service for creating 

 The idea of decentralized trusted timestamping is to permanently 
embed a hash, i.e. a unique fingerprint, of a digital file in the 
distributed blockchain of a cryptocurrency.
 The implementation of 
the approach in OriginStamp computes a
 SHA-256 hash of the file 

browser. Computing the hash in the browser ensures the raw data 

charge, OriginStamp 
minimizes
 the trans
action costs (currently 
approx. 9 cents per Bitcoin transaction),
 by collecting all hashes 
received over a 24
-hour period and computing a single aggregate 
SHA-256 hash from all submitted hashes.
 OriginStamp then 
employs Base58 encoding to transform this ag
gregate hash into a 
string that conforms to the requirements for a valid Bitcoin 
address 
[7]. Since the aggregate hash is unique, so 
is the resulting 
Bitcoin address. OriginStamp triggers a transaction to this address 
to which it transfers 
the 
smallest 
unit of Bitcoin, i.e. 1 Satoshi.
                                                                 6  https://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs/

   8  available for testing from: 
https://www.gipp.com/cryptsubmit/
   9 www.originstamp.org
. Before registering originstamp.org, 
the 
service was available at http

 since 2012.

OJS.
value
, 1 Satoshi is 
equivalent 
to 0.00001 USD
, so this cost is negligible in comparison to the previously 
mentioned transaction fee.
 Since the 
Bitcoin 
address 
derives from
 the aggregate hash and
 each 
Bitcoin transaction is assigned a 
timestamp, both 
a representation of the
 content
 and its 
time 
of 
existence 
are 
stored and cryptographically secured 
in the 
blockchain.
 As soon as the 
block
 containing that
 transaction
 is 
formed
 and confirmed
 (average duration of 10 minutes)
, the 
transaction 
will be 
permanently 
embedded in 
all copies of the 
decentralized 
blockchain
.  The benefit of the blockchain
-based approach, compared to 
traditional digital timestamping 
[1, 10]
, is the independence of a 
central timestamping authority (TSA). In traditional digital 
timestamping, a TSA issues the timestamps and verifies their 
validity. This approach requires trust in the integrity
 of the TSA,
 and ties the verifiability of timestamps to the availability of the 
TSA. If the TSA is compromised, e.g.
, due to technical errors or 
malicious activity, timestamps could be altered. If the TSA 
becomes unavailable, timestamps are no longer veri
fiable. 
In 
decentralized trusted timestamping, t
he cryptographic security of 
blockchains replaces the need for trust in a TSA. The created 
timestamp
s are secure as long as the cryptographic 
mechanisms of 
the blockchain 
are secure.
   3.2 CryptSubmit Figure 1 shows 
the architecture of the 
CryptSubmit 
system
. The 
system

 provides 
standard f
unctionality
 for 
user registration, 
manuscript 
upload
 as well as 
for the organization of
 the 
peer
 review
 process
. When
 authors
 submit 
their
 manuscript
, and optional
ly supplementary 
material
, such as images, videos, or 
data files, 

the submitted 
file
s and sends their 
hash
 via 
POST
 request to the 
OriginStamp 
API. Once the hash 
of the submitted files 
has been
 embedded 
in the blockchain
, the 

author
s receive a zip
-archive 
containing the submitted files
. Zipping the files prevents 
accidental alterations to the files
. Additionally, the timestamp and 
a confirmation link are 
displayed in the 
system 
frontend
.  The 
authors also 
receive 
a confirmation
 email with 
all data needed 
to verify the inclusion of their hash
(es) in the blockchain even if 
the CryptSubmit
 manuscript submission platform 
would no longer 
exist
. One option for verifying the existence 
and time 
of a 
transaction 
is to use one of the many visual blockchain explorers, 
such as blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info. Alternatively, users 
can directly search within a copy of the blockchain.
 The 
timestamp is guaranteed to be verifiable as long as a single copy
 of the blockchain exists. Since the blockchain is redundantly 
stored on thousands of computing nodes, the persistency of the 
timestamp is virtually guaranteed.
 Reviewers 
give 
feedback
 using an 
online form 
following 
the same 
process 
as in currently existin
g manuscript submission systems.
 In contrast to existing systems, 
CryptSubmit 
timestamp
s each 
submitted review 
 once 
with and 
once 
without 
the 
identifying 
information of reviewers, 
e.g.
, name, email, affiliation
, and 
an ORCID10 if provided. 
The timestamp 
of the anonymous version of 
the form 
is 
provided
 to the authors of the reviewed manuscript. 
The other timestamp is 
sent to the reviewer and
 is visible 
in the 
reviewer and organizer view of the system
. Since 
all 
timestamp
s are verifiable independent of the 
CryptSubmit system, authors can 
give credit to reviewers
, e.g., for providing valuable ideas, by 
citing
 the transaction 
that records the 
feedback in the
 blockchain.
 CryptSubmit allows authors to request
 lifting the anonymity of 
reviewers to 
allow citing th
e received feedback. If the reviewers 
agree to the request
, the authors 
are granted access to the review 
form 
with 
 Augmenting 
a manuscript submission
 system 
with decentralized 
trusted timestamping 
results in several improvements
. First, 
authors
 receive a 
tamperproof 
timestamp for the
ir research 
manuscript 
as it existed
, bit
-exact
, at the time of submission. 
The persistence and verifiability of 
this 
timestamp is 
independent
 of 
the 
integrity of the 
submission platform
. If data or results are 
leaked prior to publication in the intended 
venue
, researchers can 
use the timestamp to support their claim 
to research contributions.
 Second, the approach 
may 
deter plagiarists
, since all individuals 
involved in the manuscript submission and peer review process, 
e.g.
 program committee members 
and 
reviewers,
 are aware 
that a 

time of 
existence
 is permanently 
verifiable.
 The idea 
                                                                 10  https://orcid.org
  of CryptSubmit is not to prevent academi
c plagiarism, but rather  
to help authors prove their intellectual property and to  support 
examiners in more easily confirming the existence of plagiarism, 
which is also a goal of plagiarism detection and visualization tools 
[6]. Just as existing automated plagiarism detection systems can 
only
 deter potential plagiarists 
[8]
, CryptSubmit will not prevent 
academic 
plagiarism, but its capability may deter some plagiarists.
 Finally
, reviewers 
could be
 incentiv
ized
 to more openly share 
their own ideas
, since they receive a proof of existence for their 
feedback 
and can allow authors to cite their contributions.
 We 
have 
integrat
ed the proposed concept into the open
-source 
manuscript submission
 system 
OJS as a proof
-of concept, and 
made 
the code available
 under a
 GNU General Public
 License
 to 
encourage other developers to integrate 
decentralized trusted 
timestamping into their own conference management systems.
 Currently, we are in contact with leading pro
viders of manuscript 
submission systems to explore the possibility of integrating 
trusted timestamping into an established system.
 4. CONCLUSION
 & FUTURE WORK
 We introduced 
an approach 
for securely timestamp
ing manuscripts 
and review
er feedback 
submitted 
in m
anuscript 
submission systems using 
Bitcoin
 blockchain. 
This
 procedure 
allows
 the author
s and the 
public
 to independently 
verify that 
a manuscript
, a dataset, or 
other 
research result
s already existed 
in a 
precise format 
at the time of submission to a 
conference or 
journal
. Researchers 
must 
not place 
their 
trust in the security 
or 
the existence 
of the submission platform 
itself 
to verif
y the
 time at 
which a 
manuscript was submitted
. As a result, p
lagiarism of yet 
unpublished
 research results due to leak
s, or 
peer reviewer 
dishonesty, can 
more easily be proven by the original author
.  The proposed approach could equally benefit 
other 
submission 
systems
, e.g.
, for research grant 
proposals
, or university 
applications. The approach can also be 
integrated
 into 
open science repositories, 
such as 

11, where 
researchers can upload their datasets,
 or 
into 
online pre
-print 
repositories, such as arXiv.org
12.  The idea of embedding 
data 
in 
a cryptographically secured 
blockchain 
could be expanded to
 the point where the full text
s of 
the manuscripts are
 openly stored on a blockchain 
ledger
. Existing 
pre-print services
, typically maintained by a single provider,
 could 
be replaced with a
 decentralized
 open access 
pre
-print service that 
leverages a 
blockchain
 to transparently store files and verifiably 
track all changes performed on those
 files. The blockchain could 
for instance be maintained by 
a network of
 research institutions, 
government agencies
, and other organizations.

 ABSTRACT
 Manuscript submission systems are a 
central fixture in scholarly 
publishing
. However, 
with 
existing systems
, r
esearchers
 must 
trust that 
their yet 
unpublished findings
 will not 
prematurely
 be 
disseminated
 due to technical 
weaknesses
 and that anonymous 
peer reviewers 
or committee members 
will not plagiarize 
unpublished 
content
. To address 
this
 limitation
, we 
present 
CryptSubmit 
 a system
 that automatically create
s a decentralized
, tamperproof, 
and 
publicly
 verifiable 
timestamp for 
each
 submitted 
manuscript
 by 
utilizing the blockchain
 of t
he cryptocurrency 
Bitcoin
. The 
publicly
 accessible and tamperproof 
infrastructure
 of 
the blockchain 
allows researchers to 
independ
ently verify the 
validity of the
 timestamp associated with their manuscript
 at the 
time of submiss
ion to a conference or journ
al. Our system 
supports researchers in protecting their intellectual property even 
in the face of vulnerable submission platforms or dishonest peer 
reviewers. Optionally, the system also generates trusted 
timestamps for the feedback shared by peer reviewer
s to increase 
the traceability of ideas. 
CryptSubmit 
integrates these features 
into 
the open source conference management system OJS. 
In the 
future, the method could be integrated at nearly no overhead cost 
into other manuscript submission systems, such as
 EasyChair, 
ConfTool, or Ambra. The introduced method can also improve 
electronic pre
-print services and storage systems for research data.

. 1. INTRODUCTION
 Manuscript submission 
systems 
have become
 a standard tool
 in scholarly publishing. These systems 
help
 organizers of 
academic 
conferences and journals coordinate 
all stages of
 the publishing 
process: from 
abstract and manuscript submission, 
to organizing 
peer
 review
, and finally
 receiving
 camera
-ready
 manuscripts
. Manuscript submission 
systems
 have significantly 
reduced
 the 
receipt
-to-acceptance 
wait 
time
, thus benefiting organizers and 
researchers alike
 [16]. Although manuscript submission sy
stems have made 
peer review
 more 
efficient, 
technical weaknesses and 
potential 
dishonesty 
of the involved 
individuals 
threaten the 
integrity of the 
scientific peer review 
process
. A first weakness, of
 technical 
nature, 
is the lack of standards for
 the secur
e architecture
 of 
manuscript submission 
systems
. To 
give
 one example, 
from 200
4 - 2011, 
Sheridan Printing

management software
, which was used by many 
ACM 
conferences, including WWW 
and SIGCHI, featured 
an easily 
guessable naming scheme fo
r paper submissions 
[17]. This
 weakness 
enabled anyone with the base URL to systematically 
retrieve all papers submitted to a conference
 months before their 
publication.
 Such 
data leaks from submission platforms 
can lead
 to the premature 
release 
of results
, the 
plagiarism of ideas, or even 
the loss of 
potential 
patent applications 
if the description of an
 idea is 
made 
openly available on
 the W
eb.
  A further weakness, 
this time
 of human
 nature, is the 
risk of 
bias 
or fraud
 in the 
peer
-review process
. Some reviewers 
may 
criticize 
a submitted 
manuscript
 more harshly than justified with the aim of 
delaying 
competing researchers
. In extreme
 cases, peer
 reviewers, 
chairs, or 
editors may reject
 a manuscript
 only to use 
its valuable 
findings 
in their
 own research 
and publication
. Such unethical 
behavior is likely rare
. However, 
several cases have been 
publicized 
in which 
peer
 reviewers
 plagiarized ideas and results 
from the unpublished manuscripts
 they reviewed 
[3, 5, 14, 15]
. Only r
ecently
, a medical 
researcher 
discovered that 
five
 
worth of
 
data
 had 
been plagiarized
 and published.
 The
 plagiarist 
had 
received access to 
this data while acting as 
a peer 
reviewer for 
a prestigious medical journal
, where he 
had rejected
 the original 
manuscript
 before
 publish
ing the 
data
 as if it
 was his own [4]. Such severe 
cases
 of 
academic misconduct remind us
 that entrusting anonymous reviewers with novel research
 results 
via a
 submission
 system 
poses a risk for plagiarism
.  While the 
problem of academic plagiarism is as old as academia 
itself 
[12] and can never be entirely eliminated, 
the development 
and use of more sophisticated plagiarism detection 
systems 
can 
help
 examiners 
to more
 quickly 
discover
 the extent of plagiarism
, as well as 
to increas
e the effort 
plagiarists must put forth to avoid 
detection
 [6, 11]
. We 
expect
 that having
 a means to securely 
verify
 priority for 
research 
manuscript
s upon their submission 
represents 
one 
additional deterrence against 
academic 
plagiarism.
 However, c
urrently
, researchers are missing a 
method
 to 
securely 
and effortlessly 
prove their 
academic 
contribution
s in the 
face of
 data leakage or 
reviewer 
fraud. 
   978-1-5386-3861-3/17/$31.00 ©2017 IEEEThe question arises:
 How can researchers 
verify 
that their contribution already existed 
at the
 time
 of submission 
to a conference
 or journal? In this paper
, we propose a 
method
 which enables researcher
s to securely verify the 
existence of 
research 
ideas, data, 
or results 
at the time of 
a manuscript
 submission
 for review
. The proposed 
method generates
 a hash, i.e. 
a unique 
fingerprint
, of 
the research 
manuscript and 
accompanying
 data
, if included. 
The
 hash is 
embedded
 in the
 tamper
proof blockchain of 
the cryptocurrency 
Bitcoin, however, any
 blockchain
, e.g. Ethereum
, could equally be 
used for this purpose
. This approach
, coined in a previous paper 
as decentralized trusted timestamping 
[7], associates 
a digital file
 with a tamperproof
 timestamp 
recorded on the blockchain 
that 
is 
permanently and 
public
ly verifiable
. If a manuscript

 is misappropriated 
later
, the 
trusted 
timestamp
 allows
 the 
author 
to 
prove that the manuscript 
already existed 
in a precise state 
when it was submitted to 
a conference 
or journal
  fully 
independent of 
the 
manuscript 
submission system used.
 2. EXISTING SYSTEMS
 While several applications 
exist that 

for trusted
-timestamping 
[2, 9]
, no system
 exists
 that
 utilizes
 the 
blockchain with the objective 
of enabling researchers to 
document 
priority for 
their 
academic manuscript
s. 
ystems 
supporting the academic 
publishing process can 
be categori
zed into 
electronic publishing systems, also referred to 
as journal management 
systems, 
and conference management 
systems
. Both types
 of systems
 support the 
peer
-review process
: from accepting
 manuscript 
submissions
, over 
selecting 
reviewers
 and managing 
their
 feedback
, to accepting 
the final manuscript 
and formatting
 it for publication.
 Conference management 
systems
 typically 
include event organization 
functionalit
ies, as 
well as 
registration
 and payment handling
. Since our 
presented
 approach addresses
 the peer
-revie
w process
, we examine
 both 
system 
types
, as long as they offer a 
peer
-review 
functionality
.  Editorial Manager

is a widely-used commercial 
journal 
management system. 
Publishers
, such as Springer
 Nature, 
BMC and PLO
S, employ
 this 
mature and feature
-rich 
system
 to manage thousands of journals
. Among
 academic
 conference 
management system
s, EasyChair
2 and ConfTool3 are 
widely-used 
solutions. B
oth systems 
follow 
a freemium business model
, i.e.
, offer
ing a free
 basic vers
ion, while requiring payment for
 more 
advanced features
. The
 code of 
the
 systems 
is not open
 source
 and 
. A review of 
additional 
systems can be found in 
[13].  In the following, we focus on popular 
open
-source
 systems
, since 
these 
give us
 the 
opportunity
 to instantaneously integrate 
the capability of 
trusted 
timestamping
. Ambra

 Java-based 
journal management system
 maintained by the Public Library of 
Science (PLOS)
 and employed by several PLOS journals.
 The PHP-based
 Ope
n Journal System
 (OJS)
5 offers 
comparable 
features and degree of maturity
 as Ambra
. OJS is 
developed 
by

HotCRP
7 is an 
alternative 
open-source

management 
system
 used by 
several 
ACM SIG
 conferences
. OJS, 
OCS and 
HotCRP offer the option of using a hosted instance 
of 
the system
s for a fee.
 Deploying the system
s 
is free of charge
, as is the case for 
Ambra
.  While openly available
 manuscript submission systems exist
, they 
share the same shortcoming: 
they provide 
authors 
with 
no mechanism to 
obtain a persistent piece of evidence that is 
independent of the system itself and enables authors to verifiably 
prove th
at a research work was submitted at a given time. 
The most evidence 
provided by 
existing sy
stems 
is a confirmation 
email to acknowledge
 the 
receipt
 of the manuscript. However, 
the verifiability of 
the content of 
confirmation 
emails depends
 on 
the 
availability of a corresponding 
data 
record on the side of the 
publisher to 
whom 
the manuscript was submitted. 
This record 
can 
easily go missing, e.g.
, due to limited retention periods for such 
data, because the 
manuscript submission
 system changes, or
 because the publisher ceases to exist. The data record may also be 
manipulated, e.g., by 
malicious conference organizers
 or editors 
who plan to plagiarize 
from submitted 
work.  3. SYSTEM CONCEPT
 Having described
 the limitations of existing manus
cript 
submiss
ion systems, 
we present
 the concept and prototype
, CryptSubmit8, which we implemented into the open
-source 
manuscript submission 
system
 OJS. CryptSubmit uses the 
blockchain of Bitcoin to enable tamperproof, decentralized 
timestamping of all data exchanged during the manuscript 
submission and peer review process. 
Section
 3.1
 describes the 
blockchain
-based approach to timestamping and our service 
OriginStamp, which CryptSubmit uses to generate trusted 
timestamps. Section 
3.2
 presents details on
 CryptSubmit.
 3.1 Trusted Timestamping on the Blockchain
 We introduced decentralized trusted timestamping of digital files 
using the blockchain of a cryptocurrency as the medium for 
timestamp generation and verification in 
[7]. With OriginStamp
9, we provide a non
-commercial, web
-based service for creating 

 The idea of decentralized trusted timestamping is to permanently 
embed a hash, i.e. a unique fingerprint, of a digital file in the 
distributed blockchain of a cryptocurrency.
 The implementation of 
the approach in OriginStamp computes a
 SHA-256 hash of the file 

browser. Computing the hash in the browser ensures the raw data 

charge, OriginStamp 
minimizes
 the trans
action costs (currently 
approx. 9 cents per Bitcoin transaction),
 by collecting all hashes 
received over a 24
-hour period and computing a single aggregate 
SHA-256 hash from all submitted hashes.
 OriginStamp then 
employs Base58 encoding to transform this ag
gregate hash into a 
string that conforms to the requirements for a valid Bitcoin 
address 
[7]. Since the aggregate hash is unique, so 
is the resulting 
Bitcoin address. OriginStamp triggers a transaction to this address 
to which it transfers 
the 
smallest 
unit of Bitcoin, i.e. 1 Satoshi.
                                                                 6  https://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs/

   8  available for testing from: 
https://www.gipp.com/cryptsubmit/
   9 www.originstamp.org
. Before registering originstamp.org, 
the 
service was available at http

 since 2012.

OJS.
value
, 1 Satoshi is 
equivalent 
to 0.00001 USD
, so this cost is negligible in comparison to the previously 
mentioned transaction fee.
 Since the 
Bitcoin 
address 
derives from
 the aggregate hash and
 each 
Bitcoin transaction is assigned a 
timestamp, both 
a representation of the
 content
 and its 
time 
of 
existence 
are 
stored and cryptographically secured 
in the 
blockchain.
 As soon as the 
block
 containing that
 transaction
 is 
formed
 and confirmed
 (average duration of 10 minutes)
, the 
transaction 
will be 
permanently 
embedded in 
all copies of the 
decentralized 
blockchain
.  The benefit of the blockchain
-based approach, compared to 
traditional digital timestamping 
[1, 10]
, is the independence of a 
central timestamping authority (TSA). In traditional digital 
timestamping, a TSA issues the timestamps and verifies their 
validity. This approach requires trust in the integrity
 of the TSA,
 and ties the verifiability of timestamps to the availability of the 
TSA. If the TSA is compromised, e.g.
, due to technical errors or 
malicious activity, timestamps could be altered. If the TSA 
becomes unavailable, timestamps are no longer veri
fiable. 
In 
decentralized trusted timestamping, t
he cryptographic security of 
blockchains replaces the need for trust in a TSA. The created 
timestamp
s are secure as long as the cryptographic 
mechanisms of 
the blockchain 
are secure.
   3.2 CryptSubmit Figure 1 shows 
the architecture of the 
CryptSubmit 
system
. The 
system

 provides 
standard f
unctionality
 for 
user registration, 
manuscript 
upload
 as well as 
for the organization of
 the 
peer
 review
 process
. When
 authors
 submit 
their
 manuscript
, and optional
ly supplementary 
material
, such as images, videos, or 
data files, 

the submitted 
file
s and sends their 
hash
 via 
POST
 request to the 
OriginStamp 
API. Once the hash 
of the submitted files 
has been
 embedded 
in the blockchain
, the 

author
s receive a zip
-archive 
containing the submitted files
. Zipping the files prevents 
accidental alterations to the files
. Additionally, the timestamp and 
a confirmation link are 
displayed in the 
system 
frontend
.  The 
authors also 
receive 
a confirmation
 email with 
all data needed 
to verify the inclusion of their hash
(es) in the blockchain even if 
the CryptSubmit
 manuscript submission platform 
would no longer 
exist
. One option for verifying the existence 
and time 
of a 
transaction 
is to use one of the many visual blockchain explorers, 
such as blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info. Alternatively, users 
can directly search within a copy of the blockchain.
 The 
timestamp is guaranteed to be verifiable as long as a single copy
 of the blockchain exists. Since the blockchain is redundantly 
stored on thousands of computing nodes, the persistency of the 
timestamp is virtually guaranteed.
 Reviewers 
give 
feedback
 using an 
online form 
following 
the same 
process 
as in currently existin
g manuscript submission systems.
 In contrast to existing systems, 
CryptSubmit 
timestamp
s each 
submitted review 
 once 
with and 
once 
without 
the 
identifying 
information of reviewers, 
e.g.
, name, email, affiliation
, and 
an ORCID10 if provided. 
The timestamp 
of the anonymous version of 
the form 
is 
provided
 to the authors of the reviewed manuscript. 
The other timestamp is 
sent to the reviewer and
 is visible 
in the 
reviewer and organizer view of the system
. Since 
all 
timestamp
s are verifiable independent of the 
CryptSubmit system, authors can 
give credit to reviewers
, e.g., for providing valuable ideas, by 
citing
 the transaction 
that records the 
feedback in the
 blockchain.
 CryptSubmit allows authors to request
 lifting the anonymity of 
reviewers to 
allow citing th
e received feedback. If the reviewers 
agree to the request
, the authors 
are granted access to the review 
form 
with 
 Augmenting 
a manuscript submission
 system 
with decentralized 
trusted timestamping 
results in several improvements
. First, 
authors
 receive a 
tamperproof 
timestamp for the
ir research 
manuscript 
as it existed
, bit
-exact
, at the time of submission. 
The persistence and verifiability of 
this 
timestamp is 
independent
 of 
the 
integrity of the 
submission platform
. If data or results are 
leaked prior to publication in the intended 
venue
, researchers can 
use the timestamp to support their claim 
to research contributions.
 Second, the approach 
may 
deter plagiarists
, since all individuals 
involved in the manuscript submission and peer review process, 
e.g.
 program committee members 
and 
reviewers,
 are aware 
that a 

time of 
existence
 is permanently 
verifiable.
 The idea 
                                                                 10  https://orcid.org
  of CryptSubmit is not to prevent academi
c plagiarism, but rather  
to help authors prove their intellectual property and to  support 
examiners in more easily confirming the existence of plagiarism, 
which is also a goal of plagiarism detection and visualization tools 
[6]. Just as existing automated plagiarism detection systems can 
only
 deter potential plagiarists 
[8]
, CryptSubmit will not prevent 
academic 
plagiarism, but its capability may deter some plagiarists.
 Finally
, reviewers 
could be
 incentiv
ized
 to more openly share 
their own ideas
, since they receive a proof of existence for their 
feedback 
and can allow authors to cite their contributions.
 We 
have 
integrat
ed the proposed concept into the open
-source 
manuscript submission
 system 
OJS as a proof
-of concept, and 
made 
the code available
 under a
 GNU General Public
 License
 to 
encourage other developers to integrate 
decentralized trusted 
timestamping into their own conference management systems.
 Currently, we are in contact with leading pro
viders of manuscript 
submission systems to explore the possibility of integrating 
trusted timestamping into an established system.
 4. CONCLUSION
 & FUTURE WORK
 We introduced 
an approach 
for securely timestamp
ing manuscripts 
and review
er feedback 
submitted 
in m
anuscript 
submission systems using 
Bitcoin
 blockchain. 
This
 procedure 
allows
 the author
s and the 
public
 to independently 
verify that 
a manuscript
, a dataset, or 
other 
research result
s already existed 
in a 
precise format 
at the time of submission to a 
conference or 
journal
. Researchers 
must 
not place 
their 
trust in the security 
or 
the existence 
of the submission platform 
itself 
to verif
y the
 time at 
which a 
manuscript was submitted
. As a result, p
lagiarism of yet 
unpublished
 research results due to leak
s, or 
peer reviewer 
dishonesty, can 
more easily be proven by the original author
.  The proposed approach could equally benefit 
other 
submission 
systems
, e.g.
, for research grant 
proposals
, or university 
applications. The approach can also be 
integrated
 into 
open science repositories, 
such as 

11, where 
researchers can upload their datasets,
 or 
into 
online pre
-print 
repositories, such as arXiv.org
12.  The idea of embedding 
data 
in 
a cryptographically secured 
blockchain 
could be expanded to
 the point where the full text
s of 
the manuscripts are
 openly stored on a blockchain 
ledger
. Existing 
pre-print services
, typically maintained by a single provider,
 could 
be replaced with a
 decentralized
 open access 
pre
-print service that 
leverages a 
blockchain
 to transparently store files and verifiably 
track all changes performed on those
 files. The blockchain could 
for instance be maintained by 
a network of
 research institutions, 
government agencies
, and other organizations.
